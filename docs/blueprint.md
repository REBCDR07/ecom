## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, energetic yellow (#FFEB3B) to evoke a sense of trust and activity. Yellow is carefully chosen because while the inspiration is the yellow of MTN Mobile Money, that particular yellow has a somewhat drab vibe, so a livelier version should be used to evoke a different mood. The primary color provides ample contrast against either a light or a dark background.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated yellow (#F5F5DC) that is functionally a pale cream.
- Accent color: An analogous but more saturated, lively orange (#FF8F00) to complement the primary yellow, drawing the eye and making interactive elements more visible. The orange will not only differentiate itself from the yellow by a boost in saturation, but also in brightness, as is needed for effective contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif combining a modern look and a little warmth.
- Use consistent and clear icons for navigation, product categories, and user actions, focusing on recognizability and ease of understanding.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout, optimizing for mobile-first responsiveness and ensuring key features are easily accessible.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as loading spinners, button hover effects, and page transitions.
